# Clapperboard

Want record yourself playing guitar with a camcorder while using the audio from
your audio interface? No problem, we've got you covered!

Clapperboard syncronizes your video an audio by using a clapperboard-like
technique. If you don't know what I'm talking about, have a look at this post
-> http://www.learningguitarnow.com/blog/recording/how-to-record-a-video-while-playing-over-a-backing-track/

Instead of using a pricy UI based NLE, you can instead use this handy command
line script to sync your video and audio tracks.
